    The conversational interface service for the Tessera platform
  </p>
</p>

## Why "Convesa"?

**Conversa** is the conversational interface service for the Tessera platform.

It acts as a channel adapter and orchestration layer that enables users to interact with Tessera resources through conversational platforms (Telegram initially, later WhatsApp, web chat, voice, etc.), while keeping Tessera API- and MCP-centric.

Conversa does not own business data and does not implement domain logic.
All reasoning and data access are delegated to Tessera via APIs and MCP.
